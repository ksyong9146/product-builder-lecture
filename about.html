                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Animal Face Test, a fun project born from a curiosity about the intersection of technology and everyday life. Our mission is to provide a delightful and engaging experience using the power of artificial intelligence. We believe that technology, even at its most complex, can be used to create simple moments of joy and self-discovery.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>This website uses a sophisticated machine learning model, powered by Google's Teachable Machine. The model has been trained on thousands of images of dogs and cats to learn their distinct facial features. When you upload your photo, our algorithm analyzes it in real-time to determine which animal's features most closely resemble your own.</p>
                <p><strong>Importantly, this process happens entirely within your browser. Your photos are never uploaded, stored, or seen by us.</strong> Your privacy is paramount.</p>
