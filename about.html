                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Animal Face Test was born from a simple question: What if we could use cutting-edge artificial intelligence to create moments of joy and self-discovery? In a world where AI is often associated with complex, serious applications, we wanted to show that this powerful technology can also be fun, accessible, and entertaining for everyone.</p>
                <p>What started as a weekend project exploring Google's Teachable Machine platform quickly evolved into something more meaningful. We discovered that people genuinely enjoy learning about themselves through playful experiences, and the comparison between human faces and beloved pets like dogs and cats resonated deeply with our early users.</p>

                <h2>The Technology Behind Our Test</h2>
                <p>Our animal face analysis is powered by a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that we trained using Google's Teachable Machine platform. Here's a deeper look at the technology:</p>

                <h3>What is a Convolutional Neural Network?</h3>
                <p>A CNN is a type of artificial neural network specifically designed for processing visual data. Inspired by the human visual cortex, CNNs use layers of filters to detect patterns in images, from simple edges and shapes to complex features like facial characteristics.</p>

                <h3>How We Trained Our Model</h3>
                <p>We carefully curated a training dataset of thousands of images, teaching the model to recognize the subtle differences between dog-like and cat-like facial features. The training process involved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering diverse images representing various facial types, ages, and ethnicities to ensure broad applicability</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Learning:</strong> Allowing the neural network to identify which facial features are most predictive of dog-like vs. cat-like classifications</li>
                    <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Testing the model against held-out images to ensure consistent, reliable results</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Fine-tuning the model for browser-based performance without sacrificing accuracy</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why TensorFlow.js?</h3>
                <p>We chose to deploy our model using TensorFlow.js, Google's machine learning library for JavaScript. This allows the entire analysis to happen in your browser, meaning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No server uploads required - your photos stay on your device</li>
                    <li>Instant results with no network latency</li>
                    <li>Works offline once the page is loaded</li>
                    <li>Complete privacy and security</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Science of Facial Perception</h2>
                <p>The idea that human faces can resemble animals isn't just whimsical - it has roots in scientific research. Physiognomy, the practice of assessing character from facial features, dates back to ancient civilizations. While modern science doesn't support using facial features to determine personality, research does show that certain facial characteristics create consistent perceptions.</p>

                <p>Studies in psychology have shown that faces with rounded features, larger eyes, and softer contours (what researchers call "baby-faced" features) are consistently perceived as more warm, trustworthy, and approachable - traits we often associate with dogs. Conversely, faces with angular features, narrower eyes, and defined bone structure are perceived as more independent, intelligent, and mysterious - characteristics we associate with cats.</p>

                <p>Our AI model captures these subtle differences, providing a fun way to explore the science of facial perception while reminding us that everyone's face tells a unique story.</p>
