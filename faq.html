                <h2>About the Test</h2>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>How accurate is the Animal Face Test?</h3>
                    <p>Our AI model was trained on thousands of images and provides consistent, reproducible results. However, it's important to understand that this test is designed primarily for entertainment purposes. The classification of faces as "dog-like" or "cat-like" is based on learned patterns in facial features, but individual results may vary based on factors like photo quality, lighting, angle, and facial expression.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Why did I get a different result with a different photo?</h3>
                    <p>Several factors can influence your result:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Different lighting can change how your facial features appear to the AI</li>
                        <li><strong>Angle:</strong> A photo taken from a different angle may emphasize different features</li>
                        <li><strong>Expression:</strong> Smiling vs. neutral expressions can affect the analysis</li>
                        <li><strong>Image quality:</strong> Higher resolution photos provide more detail for analysis</li>
                        <li><strong>Makeup or accessories:</strong> These can alter the apparent shape of facial features</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the most consistent results, use a clear, front-facing photo with good lighting and a neutral expression.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Does my result mean I have a certain personality?</h3>
                    <p>No. While the test is based on research showing that certain facial features create consistent social perceptions (warmth vs. sophistication), your facial features do not determine your actual personality. The test is meant to be a fun exploration of facial perception, not a personality assessment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Can I be both a dog and a cat face?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, in a sense. The AI provides a percentage that indicates how strongly your features lean toward one category or the other. If you receive a result close to 50%, it means your features have characteristics of both types. Most people fall somewhere in between rather than being 100% one type.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Why only dogs and cats? What about other animals?</h3>
                    <p>We chose dogs and cats because they're the most common pets and have well-established cultural associations with specific personality traits (loyal and friendly vs. independent and elegant). These associations make the results more meaningful and relatable. We may add more animals in future versions of the test.</p>

                <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>What technology powers the Animal Face Test?</h3>
                    <p>Our test uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained using Google's Teachable Machine platform. The model runs in your browser using TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for machine learning. This combination allows for sophisticated AI analysis while maintaining complete privacy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Does the test work offline?</h3>
                    <p>Once the page is fully loaded (including the AI model), the test can work offline. The actual face analysis doesn't require an internet connection because everything happens locally in your browser. However, you'll need an internet connection to initially load the page and download the model.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>What browsers are supported?</h3>
                    <p>Animal Face Test works on all modern browsers that support JavaScript and WebGL, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Chrome (version 70 or later)</li>
                        <li>Mozilla Firefox (version 65 or later)</li>
                        <li>Safari (version 12 or later)</li>
                        <li>Microsoft Edge (version 79 or later)</li>
                        <li>Opera (version 57 or later)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We recommend using the latest version of your preferred browser for the best experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Does it work on mobile devices?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Animal Face Test is fully responsive and works on smartphones and tablets. You can upload photos directly from your device's camera roll or take a new photo using your device's camera.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Why is the page loading slowly?</h3>
                    <p>The initial page load may take a few seconds because we need to download the AI model to your browser. This model is optimized for size but still requires some data transfer. Once loaded, the analysis itself is very fast. If you experience persistent slow loading, try:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Checking your internet connection</li>
                        <li>Clearing your browser cache</li>
                        <li>Trying a different browser</li>
                        <li>Disabling browser extensions that might interfere</li>

                <h2>Usage Tips</h2>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>What kind of photo works best?</h3>
                    <p>For the most accurate results, use a photo that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shows your face clearly from the front</li>
                        <li>Has good, even lighting (natural light is best)</li>
                        <li>Is in focus and high resolution</li>
                        <li>Shows your face without obstructions (no sunglasses, masks, or hair covering your face)</li>
                        <li>Features a relatively neutral expression</li>
                        <li>Contains only one person</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Can I test other people's photos?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can use the test with any photo. Many people enjoy testing friends, family members, or even celebrities. Just remember that since all processing happens locally, whatever photos you use remain private on your device.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>Can I use photos with multiple people?</h3>
                    <p>The test works best with photos featuring a single person. If multiple faces are in the photo, the AI may analyze one face or produce less reliable results. For best results, use photos with only the face you want to analyze.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3>What file formats are supported?</h3>
                    <p>Animal Face Test supports common image formats including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)</li>
                        <li>PNG (.png)</li>
                        <li>GIF (.gif) - first frame only for animated GIFs</li>
                        <li>WebP (.webp)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The maximum recommended file size is 10MB, though smaller files will load faster.</p>
