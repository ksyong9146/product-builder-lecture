            <h2>The Science Behind Animal Face Analysis</h2>
            <p>The concept of comparing human faces to animals has deep roots in both science and culture. Physiognomy, the practice of assessing character from facial features, has been studied for centuries. While our test is designed for entertainment, it draws on real observations about facial structure and perceived personality traits.</p>

            <h3>What Makes a "Dog Face"?</h3>
            <p>People with dog-like facial features often have rounder faces, wider-set eyes, and more prominent cheeks. These features are associated with warmth, friendliness, and approachability in psychological studies. The term "baby face" in research often overlaps with what we might call dog-like features.</p>

            <h3>What Makes a "Cat Face"?</h3>
            <p>Cat-like facial features typically include more angular bone structure, almond-shaped eyes, and higher cheekbones. These features are often perceived as elegant, mysterious, and sophisticated. Studies show people with these features are often seen as independent and intelligent.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning and Facial Analysis</h3>
            <p>Our AI uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image analysis. The model has been trained using Google's Teachable Machine platform, learning to identify the subtle patterns that distinguish dog-like from cat-like facial features across thousands of training images.</p>
