# Personal Color Website Blueprint

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a Korean personal color diagnosis website, referenced from `https://mycolor.kr/`. The website will be visually appealing, mobile-responsive, and provide a simplified, quiz-based personal color diagnosis tool. The content is optimized for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) based on strategies for the generative AI era.

## Implemented Features
- **Quiz-based Diagnosis:** A series of questions to help users determine their personal color.
- **Result Page:** A page displaying the user's personal color result.
- **Modern Design:** A clean and modern design inspired by the reference site.
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization):** Content is structured and written to be easily understood and recommended by generative AI search engines.
