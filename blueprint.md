# Lotto Number Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates random lottery numbers.

## Features

*   Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   Displays the generated numbers in a visually appealing way.
*   Allows the user to generate new numbers with the click of a button.

## Plan

1.  **`index.html`**: Create the main structure of the web page, including a title, a container for the lottery numbers, and a button to trigger the number generation.
2.  **`style.css`**: Style the elements to create a clean and modern user interface. This includes styling the number balls, the button, and the overall layout.
3.  **`main.js`**: Implement the logic for generating the random numbers. This will involve:
    *   Creating a function to generate 6 unique random numbers.
    *   Adding an event listener to the button to call the generation function.
    *   Updating the DOM to display the newly generated numbers.
