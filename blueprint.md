## SEO Perfection Plan

The following steps will be taken to ensure the site is perfectly optimized for search engines like Google and Naver.

1.  **Create Missing Pages:** Create all missing HTML pages (`how-it-works.html`, `dog-vs-cat.html`, `faq.html`, `contact.html`, and `terms.html`) with high-quality, relevant content to fix broken links and improve user experience.
2.  **Fix Hardcoded URLs:** Remove hardcoded absolute URLs and use relative paths to ensure the site works correctly in any environment.
3.  **Create `robots.txt`:** Implement a `robots.txt` file to guide search engine crawlers and point them to the sitemap.
4.  **Create `sitemap.xml`:** Generate a `sitemap.xml` file to help search engines efficiently discover and index all pages on the site.
5.  **Review and Refine Content:** Audit all content for quality, uniqueness, and structure. Improve accessibility and ensure all images have descriptive alt text.
6.  **Add Favicon:** Create and link a favicon to improve brand recognition in browser tabs.
7.  **Localize for Korean Users:** Given the user's context, add Korean language support (`ko`) to make the site more accessible to Korean users.
